# Dimensions of an automata

A population of cells (the cellular automata) can exist in any number of dimensions.

Traditionally, a population is represented in either ***One***, ***Two***, or ***Three*** dimensions.


## One Dimension

A one dimension population has cells positioned only along one dimension.

```
5x1 population
```
|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ◉ | ◯ | ◯ | ◉ | ◯ |

 This is represented by having a Y axis that is only one grid unit high. Here, this grid is 5x1 in size.


## Two Dimensions

A two dimension population has cells positioned along two dimensions.

```
5x4 population
```

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ◉ | ◯ | ◯ | ◉ | ◯ |
| ◉ | ◉ | ◯ | ◉ | ◯ |
| ◯ | ◯ | ◉ | ◯ | ◉ |
| ◉ | ◉ | ◯ | ◯ | ◯ |

This is represented by having an X and Y axis that are one or more grid units in length. Here, the grid is 5x4 in size. Thus, this automata population is 5x4 in size.
