*To Do*

  1. Add start state toggel: random, seed, or specified.
    A lot of the CA examples on the internet start with one on cell and the rest off (a seed) from which the complex pattern emerges. Right now, I believe, the start states of all the cells is randomly generated.

  2. Re-orgainze code: Make a cell class. This class should be able to store state, store position (ID), store neighbor state, and store neighbor position (ID). This should make it easier to implment n-dimensional CA.

  3. Implement HDF5 data output

  4. Implment custom rule input (besides normal Wolfram rules)

  5. Allow for more states to occur (besides on/off)
